# Description

Constant sum AMM (automated market maker) is a decentralized exchange that trades two tokens in the contract.

Users will be able to add liquidity and earn swap fees, swap tokens and remove liquidity.

## Why is it called constant sum?

The amount of token to come out of the trade is determined by the following equation.

```
X = amount of token A in the contract
Y = amount of token B in the contract
K = a constant that satisfies the following equation

X + Y = K
X + Y equals some constant K, hence the name constant sum.
```

This equation X + Y = K must be true before and after every swap.

```
dx = Amount of token A that came in from the swap
dy = Amount of token B that went out from the swap
```

Before the trade:

```
X + Y = K
```

After the trade:

```
X + dx + Y - dy = K
```

Since X + Y = K, replace K in the second equation X + dx + Y - dy = K with X + Y

```
X + dx + Y - dy = X + Y
```

Cancel out X and Y on both side of the equation

```
dx - dy = 0
or simply


dx = dy
```

In other words, the amount of token coming in from a swap must equal the amount of token going out.
